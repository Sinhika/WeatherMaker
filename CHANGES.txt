v. 1.3.5:
-- Updated to properly compile & link under GNU C++ 7.5. Cleaned up compiler
   warnings. Removed old Visual Studio support; if Microsoft doesn't support
   POSIX code after 20 years, stuff 'em; I am not maintaining it. Definitely
   compiles under modern Linux. Put source code on GitHub.

v. 1.3.4:
-- Added a makefile (Makefile.nocygwin) to use Cygwin port of gcc
   to compile an executable that does not require cygwin1.dll, but
   uses standard Windows DLLs instead. (Needed for Windows version 
   of distributed executable).
-- created a Windows binary archive, wthrmkr134-win32.zip

v. 1.3.3:
-- Used gcc -MM to create dependency files instead of makedep. Now you
   don't need to have X windows installed to create dependency
   files. Thanks to the author of 'fastdep' for pointing out the
   existance of this gcc option.

v. 1.3.2:
-- Added lunar phases option
-- made new lunar phases option compilable under Windows VS.

v. 1.3.1:
-- Added Greyhawk calendar option.
-- provided  long versions of command-line arguments.  

v. 1.3.0:
-- Made calendar object that calculates season, month, printed date
   string correctly for Earth.  
-- Re-implemented Forgotten Realms calendar option.
-- Fixed headers to compile under Windows. Created Visual Studio
   makefile weather.mak. Zipped up Windows Visual Studio-specific
   files in wthrmkr_vs6.zip.

-- Added calendar configuration code to STATUS line. Breaks v 1.2.1
   and older status lines. New format STATUS line:

  printf("STATUS %hd %hd %hd %hd %hd %hd %ld %hd %hd %hd %f %hd %hd %hd %s\n", 
	 (short) pOutdoor->clime, (short) pOutdoor->terrain,
	 (short) pOutdoor->calendar_cfg, pOutdoor->year[0],
	 pOutdoor->month[0], pOutdoor->day[0], pOutdoor->elevation,
	 temperature_step, ground_temperature, 
	 wind_speed, (double) accumulation, 
	 is_special, duration_special, special_step,
	 p_prevailing_list);

v. 1.2.1:
-- added option to display temperatures in degrees Celsius option,
   other stuff in metric
-- made terse mode terser.
-- added F/C (Farenheit/Celsius) to temperature print out.
-- added mandatory year argument and made month optional. Breaks
   old-format STATUS lines. New format STATUS line:
  printf("STATUS %hd %hd %hd %hd %hd %ld %hd %hd %hd %f %hd %hd %hd %s\n", 
	 (short) pOutdoor->clime, (short) pOutdoor->terrain,
	 pOutdoor->year[0],
	 pOutdoor->month[0], pOutdoor->day[0], pOutdoor->elevation,
	 temperature_step, ground_temperature, 
	 wind_speed, (double) accumulation, 
	 is_special, duration_special, special_step,
	 p_prevailing_list);

v. 1.2.0:
-- implemented hurricane special
-- added GNU copyright & licensing stuff
-- implemented drought special
-- changed ground_temperature algorithm to use daily temperature instead of
   code temperature, as specials can change temperature. Also moved calculation
   after special processing, so specials like heat waves/cold waves can affect
   snow melt.
-- implemented extreme precipitation special
-- implemented extreme precip: thunderstorm special
-- moved "to do" list to TODO.txt
-- implemented extreme precip: hailstorm special
-- implemented extreme precip: icestorm special
-- implemented extreme precip: blizzard special
-- implemented tornado special
-- implemented fog special
-- implemented sandstorm/blowing snow special; revised gale special

v. 1.1.2:
-- broke up describe_special() into one subroutine per case in switch.

v. 1.1.1:
-- Add version label

Unlabeled v. 1.1.0:
-- added ability to input previous weather starting conditions.
   Need:
	temperature step : 0 - 10 (short)
	ground temperature ?? : short
	current windspeed : short
	accumulation : short
	is_special : T/F (short)
	special duration : 0-14 (short)
	special step :  0-1, 0-10 (short,short)
	current prevailing wind ? : (string)

   Implemented status line as:

    printf("STATUS %hd %hd %hd %hd %ld %hd %hd %hd %f %hd %hd %hd %s\n", 
	 (short) pOutdoor->clime, (short) pOutdoor->terrain,
	 pOutdoor->month[0], pOutdoor->day[0], pOutdoor->elevation,
	 temperature_step, ground_temperature, 
	 wind_speed, (double) accumulation, 
	 is_special, duration_special, special_step,
	 p_prevailing_list);

    Example output/input:
STATUS 2 4 8 15 500 12 53 45 0.000000 1 11 2 N

Unlabeled v. 1.0.0:
-- Basic temperature, wind, precipitation by climate, terrain & season implemented.
-- implemented Cold Wave & Heat Wave specials
-- implemented Gale special
-- added Forgotten Realms month names option
